# 🔐 Message Encoder & Decoder – Python Project

This is a simple Python tool that allows you to **encode** and **decode** secret messages. It’s designed to be beginner-friendly, using only basic Python features like strings, loops, and functions — no external libraries required.

## 💡 What It Does
The program asks the user if they want to encode or decode a message. It then performs basic text manipulation to either hide the message (encode) or reveal it (decode). You can use it to create fun secret messages to share with friends — like a mini spy tool!

## 🧠 Why I Built It
As a young Python developer, I wanted to build something useful yet simple. This project helped me practice:
- String manipulation
- Conditionals and loops
- User input and basic logic

It’s a great way for beginners to learn how real programs work.
